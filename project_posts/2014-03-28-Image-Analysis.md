On experience in Instagram pictures shows that we are overwhelmed by pictures with no relation with our disposal. It's the reason why we installed this modest exluding hashtags system. As a mather of fact this system is not entirely satisfying and must be updated constantly.

In order to show sunsets only, we have thought of analysing images on the server side - without loosing the instantaneous contributions and the live disposal of the subject.

So far, we haven't developped this topic and our research proved to be a dead end in finding scripts that would do the work of picture analysis. We will come back to it in the near future.
