Note : for Instagram we took the option of an intermediary solution : every 10 seconds we gather new pictures on their current API. Still on Instagram, many sunset pictures were not sunset pictures : smartphones applications overwrite their posted pictures with key words such as "dog", "cat" or "like4like" and ... "sunset".
An exclusion system on hashtags was empirically designed.
